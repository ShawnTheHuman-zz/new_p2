I know it's really late after the fact but i figured out some of the stuff
I was doing wrong. I couldnt get the tree to print right because i wasnt making empty
nodes for the empty parts of the grammar. Im still having trouble displaying the
data for each node but other than that it's outputting correctly now.

as usual the make file compiles the project automatically.
